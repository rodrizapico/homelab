## TODO

- update this README
- mount storage
- override .env defaults: https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation/#local-env-file-versus-project-directory-env-file
- handle common container env vars
- split up services so it's easier to manage them individually
- make all containers run through the vpn

## Tips

- Ensure you install docker directly from source (no snap, no bundled with OS)
